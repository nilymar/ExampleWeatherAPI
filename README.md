# ExampleWeatherAPI
example for fetching data from the Internet, using weather API - APIXU: https://www.apixu.com/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 !!! ATTENTION!!!!! - the api was replaced by a new one - weatherstack - I didn't update the code here - so it will require some work....
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i used RecyclerView to show forecast for up to 7 days (with an object for storing weather data for each day)

there is a menu where you can access the setting for the app - choosing the city and number of days for the the forecast,

in the about screen accessed from the menu you can find the sources links for the app data and icons

***YOU WILL NEED TO GET AN API KEY FROM APIXU TO USE THIS APP!!!! put it in api_key in the strings.xml file ***
